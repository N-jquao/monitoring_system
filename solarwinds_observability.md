## Solarwinds Observability Solution

<br>

1. First I setup Solarwinds
2. I then logged in at https://portal.solarwinds.cloud
3. I then installed Solarwinds agent on the Ubuntu server to be monitored

- I had to navigate to settings in online portal --> API --> Generate API
- Then I had to navigate to settings in online portal --> Agents --> Add agent

<br>

4. I then configured monitoring on the Ubuntu server

<br>

- Basic System Monitoring
  The agent automatically collects:
  
  CPU usage
  Memory utilization
  Disk usage and I/O
  Network traffic
  Process information
  System logs

<br>

5. I then went through the installation process by clicking Add data --> infrastructure --> hosts

<br>

6. After installation I had some alerts showing immediately
