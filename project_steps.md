## In  this project I created an automated monitoring infrastructure and alerting system

```bash
#The first step of the project was to create a droplet server on DigitalOcean
#This would allow me to create a virtual machine with enough ram and ssd space to deploy the complete Wazuh SIEM tool
#Memory: 4GB
#Computing power: 2 Intel vCPUs
#SSD: 120GB disk
#Ubuntu 24.04 (LTS) x64





```
